# A7
# Junit Lab Exercise
Version 1.0
It includes testcases which are defined on non implemented methods. Thus, resulting in failed test results.
Total number of tests = 13
No. of methods = 4/methods+ 1 test suite
Results of 12/13 methods will fail as they are not implemented.

Version 2.0 
This version is 1/3rd implementation of the entire program. It only implements sin function and tests the cases for all four quadrants and some other boundary values.

Version 3.0
This version implements the sin and cos method comprising 2/3rd of the entire program and it tests the cases for all the four quadrants and some other bounderies.

Version 4.0
This is the final version where sine, cosine and tan method implemented successfully and it tests the cases for all the four quadrants and some other bounderies.
Trignometeric.java class has all the trignometry funtions where in it is computing the values. TrignometericTest.java has the test suite of all test cases related to sine, cosine and tan methods. 

Version 4.1
Pending changes committed in this version.

Version 4.2
Minute bugs fixed in this version.


Below are the screenshots of the test cases:
